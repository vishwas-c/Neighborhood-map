# Neighborhood-map
Udacity Full Stack Project- Neighborhood Map to view favorite places nearby.

This project builds a webpage which consists of a map of my neighborhood. There are map markers to point to my favourite places, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. A third-party API FourSquare and Google Maps API provides additional information about each of these locations. It is designed based on MVVM pattern using Knockout JS.
